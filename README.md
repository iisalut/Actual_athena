Complexes:
This is a platformer/ visual novel game where you get to walk down the streets of new york and you have to make a series of decisions which may or may not change your out come !!
Why did we make this game ?
We wanted to challenge ourselves by coding with a completely new language, Godot. We also wanted to create a meaningful game that resonated with both of us and also related to NYC.
What were the difficulties we faced ?
We initially thought Godot would be easy since it was similar to python, however we often found ourselves frustrated because we both couldnt work on the same file. This definatly did cut down our time but we found a way to work efficiently 

This is a game of self reflection where one can end up learning more about yourself.
